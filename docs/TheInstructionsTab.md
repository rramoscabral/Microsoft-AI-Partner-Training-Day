# The Instructions Tab

The navigation pane defaults to the Instructions tab, which lists all the instructions for the lab so you can see where you're at.


## Customization

**Replacement Tokens**

Replacement Tokens are a powerful component of the Studio platform and allow for each user to have a truly unique experience.

- An example of this would be providing a link to load class specific training materials into the DVD drive: Training Centers

* Another example would be a link to switch to one of the virtual machines in the lab:Windows 10

In addition to replacement tokens, variables can be defined by the user at key points in the lab* then utilized again later in the lab.

* As an example, please type the name of your home city in the text box below.

    > This variable will be referenced again later in the lab.

**Visual Customization**

Instructions can be highly customized utilizing Markdown along with CSS and HTML. To see examples of HTML and CSS within the lab, review the information below.

## Activities

Labs may utilize activities that can take the form of multiple choice questions, short answer questions, or automated scripts that run against either virtual machines or cloud providers. Activities in a lab can be configured as either optional or required.
