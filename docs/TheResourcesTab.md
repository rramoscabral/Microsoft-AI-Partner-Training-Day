# The Resources Tab

To get started with the lab, you need to login to the Windows VM.

* Click the TypeText icon ![alt text](./SkillableLabs008.png) to automatically enter the correct credentials into the login box.

* On the VM, press Enter or click the Sign In button.

* Alternatively, you can use the Commands menu e5ulavoh.jpg in the Title Bar and use the Ctrl+Alt+Delete and Type Password buttons. ![alt text](./SkillableLabs009.png).

> Note that if there was another Virtual Machine (VM) in the lab you could switch between them using the dropdown menu in the center of the Title Bar!

## Display Menu

The Display menu ![alt text](./SkillableLabs010.png) on the title bar allows you to control the VM such as restarting or reconnecting to it. It also allows you to set the browser to full screen.
